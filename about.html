		<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>Hello, my name is Ryan Schroeder and I am currently a senior at Michigan State University working towards my Bachelor's degree in experience architecture. Experience architecture at MSU has been around for only 2 years and centers on the user experience of the web and technology as a whole. Courses include web authoring, computer science, philosophy, research and some design with a whole bunch in between.</p>
			<p>I grew up in a small, tourist town in Michigan's northern lower peninsula known only for its international supply of manhole covers made by the East Jordan Iron Works. Growing up in a town with a population over half the size of a freshman class here at Michigan State came with its challenges but I just couldn't beat the critically acclaimed skiing and Mother Nature's beauty. I graduated from East Jordan High School and moved on to my dream school and the only one I ever considered going to. MSU has opened my life up to numerous opportunities including a great job at SNworks and landing an incredible internship at the second largest mortgage lender in the country, Quicken Loans.</p>
			<p>At SNworks I am technically a Project Manager but do and have done much more than that. SNworks is a web development company owned and operated by the State News, Michigan State's student newspaper. SNworks created a proprietary content management system that it then sells to student newspapers across the country. Not only do we offer them a world class CMS, our team of student designers and developers design, build and maintain a new website for them. Being the project manager, I oversee that whole process. I am the main contact between the developers and the client making sure everything is not only on time but is exactly what the client wants. In addition to project management, I also design the websites for our new clients as well as run our support line to fix all bugs and answer any and all questions clients may have.</p>
			<p>In May, I was awarded an internship position at Quicken Loans in downtown Detroit. The summer before my final year here at MSU, I worked every day for Quicken on user experience of an internal platform for our bankers and underwriters (aka, half of our 15,000 team members). At the beginning of August, because of my accomplishments over the summer, I was awarded an extension to my internship that allowed me to work remotely while I finish my college career. I continue to work for the same team as I did over the summer and have had the opportunity to create tools and resources that have been used thousands and thousands of times.</p>
			<p>Working at both of these organizations have opened my eyes to the world of web and all of its hidden areas. I have experience in wireframes, web design, WCAG guidelines, Agile and Waterfall management methods as well as different languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP. If you would like to hear more about myself or any of these positions feel free to contact me.</p>
