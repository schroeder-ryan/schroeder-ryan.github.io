			<span class="date">August, 2015</span>
			<p>Elon University is a small, private university in Elon, North Carolina. Elon's student newspaper, The Pendulum, came to us looking for a refresh. Their organization continued to use the print first method and neglected to focus much time on their website. With a change in organizational workflows, they decided to put their website at the front and came to us at SNworks with hopes of a much more engaging website. I was the project manager for this client and worked with them through every step of the process to ensure their new site was what they had in mind.</p>

			<h2><a href="/Project/daily-cardinal.html">Daily Cardinal Website</a></h2>
			<span class="date">January, 2016</span>
			<p>University of Wisconsin - Madison's student publication, The Daily Cardinal, came to us over the summer of 2015 to create a new website for them. The CMS (Content Management System) they were using was outdated and made their workflow unnecessarily hard. They also were looking for a new website as they transitioned from printing everyday to printing just twice a week. This was forcing them to put more focus on their digital content. </p>
