			<h1>Daily Cardinal Website</h1>
			<span class="date">January, 2016</span>
			<h2>The Client</h2>
			<p>University of Wisconsin - Madison's student publication, The Daily Cardinal, came to us over the summer of 2015 to create a new website for them. The CMS (Content Management System) they were using was outdated and made their workflow unnecessarily hard. They also were looking for a new website as they transitioned from printing everyday to printing just twice a week. This was forcing them to put more focus on their digital content.</p>
			<h2>The Process</h2>
			<p>The Daily Cardinal was the first project that I did the entire designs for. We didn't have a dedicated web designer at the time so I took it upon myself to create all of the necessary designs. The major issue I had to overcome during this phase was the conflicting comments from the students who were going to be using the website and the Alumni Association who was paying for it. They both wanted the website to look and feel a certain way and it caused a lot of delays</p>
			<p>Once we were able to get the designs nailed down, development went smoothly. We were able to get a lot of our newer, less experienced developers on this website which was nice. A lot of the features on their website were unique to The Daily Cardinal as they wanted something that was going to set them apart from their rival paper, The Badger Herald. Nevertheless, despite the delays in the design phase, the January 2016 deadline was met without any issue.</p>

			<h2>Takeaways</h2>
			<p>I really enjoyed working on this project and doing the designs. Creating the designs and being the project manager definitely made for a lot of extra work but the experience was definitely worth it. The staff at The Daily Cardinal were excited the whole way and it was a pleasure working with them. Since launching their site, they have been extremely pleased both with the design and functionality of their physical site but also Snworks' proprietary CMS.</p>
