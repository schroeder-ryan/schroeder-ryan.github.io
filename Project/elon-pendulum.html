			<h1>Elon University's The Pendulum</h1>
			<span class="date">August, 2015</span>
			<h2>The Client</h2>
			<p>Elon University is a small, private university in Elon, North Carolina. Elon's student newspaper, The Pendulum, came to us looking for a refresh. Their organization continued to use the print first method and neglected to focus much time on their website. With a change in organizational workflows, they decided to put their website at the front and came to us at SNworks with hopes of a much more engaging website. I was the project manager for this client and worked with them through every step of the process to ensure their new site was what they had in mind.</p>
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>This project was the first project that I managed on my own and it proved to be challenging mainly due to the timing. I started this project right before our summer started in April of 2015. Elon wanted this to launch, to no one's surprise, before the start of the fall semester, late August 2015. This left us just the summer to design, develop and review their new website. The biggest problem was the fact that we didn't have any dedicated developers working for us over the summer.</p>
			<p>Thankfully, we were able to come up with a pretty basic design that was a huge improvement over their existing site but was pretty easy for us to roll out. We designed it before our designers left for the summer and started working on the development phase using our professional staff members. We managed to get it out in time for the beginning of the fall semester and Elon was more than happy with the final product.</p>

			<h2>Takeaways</h2>
			<p>In the end, the client was very happy with their new website and the whole project went very smoothly. Because this was my first solo project as a project manager, I learned a lot on how to manage projects. My communication skills definitely improved throughout this project especially with the time crunch making constant communication that much more important. I also learned a lot about quality assurance and making sure that everything was not only completed but completed how the client wanted it</p>
