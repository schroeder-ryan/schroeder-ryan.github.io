			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="/Images/ryanschroeder.jpeg" alt="Ryan Schroeder">
			<p>Hello, my name is Ryan Schroeder and I am currently a junior at Michigan State University working towards my Bachelor's degree in experience architecture (<a href="post/learning-tech-in-a-tech-less-community">learn more about my major in this article</a>). Experience architecture at MSU has been around for only 2 years and centers on the user experience of the web and technology as a whole. Courses include web authoring, computer science, philosophy, research and some design with a whole bunch in between.</p>
			<p>I grew up in a small, tourist town in Michigan's northern lower peninsula known only for its international supply of manhole covers made by the East Jordan Iron Works. Growing up in a town with a population over half the size of a freshman class here at Michigan State came with its challenges but I just couldn't beat the critically acclaimed skiing and Mother Nature's beauty. I graduated from East Jordan High School and moved onto my dream school and the only one I ever considered going to. Since starting at MSU, I have worked at both SNworks and the College of Arts and Letters doing two very different things to help prepare me for life after college.</p>
			<p>At SNworks I am technically a Project Manager but do and have done much more than that. SNworks is a web development company owned and operated by the State News, Michigan State's student newspaper. SNworks created a proprietary content management system that it then sells to student newspapers across the country. Not only do we offer them a world class CMS, our team of student designers and developers design, build and maintain a new website for them. Being the project manager, I oversee that whole process. I am the main contact between the developers and the client making sure everything is not only on time but is exactly what the client wants. In addition to project management, I also design the websites for our new clients as well as run our support line to fix all bugs and answer any and all questions clients may have.</p>
			<p>At the College of Arts and Letters, I work as an accessibility specialist to ensure all course material and web content throughout the college is accessible to each and every student. We test content against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium. Common tests include making sure course documents are structured appropriately with headings and that lists are used properly. We also make sure websites within the college follow the guidelines to ensure those with a disability can still access the same material.</p>
			<p>Working at both of these organizations have opened my eyes to the world of web and all of its hidden areas. I have experience in wireframes, web design, WCAG guidelines, Agile and Waterfall management methods as well as different languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP. If you would like to hear more about myself or any of these positions feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a></p>
