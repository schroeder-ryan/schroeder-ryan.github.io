			<h2>Daily Cardinal</h2>
			<span class="date">January, 2016</span>
			<p>University of Wisconsin - Madison's student publication, The Daily Cardinal, came to us over the summer of 2015 to create a new website for them. The CMS (Content Management System) they were using was outdated and made their workflow unnecessarily hard. They also were looking for a new website as they transitioned from printing everyday to printing just twice a week. This was forcing them to put more focus on their digital content.</p>

			<h2>What is Experience Architecture</h2>
			<span class="date">November, 2016</span>
			<p>As a college student, I am no stranger to the typical “college student” questions. Questions like, “what is your major?” “what do you want to do after you graduate?” are questions I get every time I travel back home for a weekend or meet someone new. Now these questions wouldn’t be so bad if I were an engineering student or an athletic training major or something more easily described but that is not the case for my major. After telling people my major is experience architecture, a common response is, “so you design buildings, right?” To answer bluntly, no I don’t.</p>
